# ff7-coaster

You know "Final Fantasy VII" and you know one of its minigame: the jet-coaster shooting game.
So here is the decompiled code of the windows version. This is just a small part of the FF7 game, but I think you can have fun trying to build it to a more recent version of windows, or seeing how it was coded.
I also included a "Visual Studio 2008" project file so you can build it/run it easely.
I didn't put the source to part of the original games which I call "FF7LIB" and "FF7SND" but included a library version of both.
You can get rid of "FF7SND" easily if you want to put your on sound/music driver here.
"FF7LIB" maybe a challenge but I guess it is feasible.
I also invite you to change the "REGISTRY" related files to something more suitable to you environment.

In order to run the game, all you need is the file "coaster.lgp" from FF7 (the windows version), and a correct registry so that the program can find it.

Have decompiled-fun !
